# Statistcal Analysis 
This dataset contains 150 samples divided into 3 classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. Each samples has 4 continous features measured in cm. The samples are as follows: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width. 
- The data was normalized using standard scaling for training and testing.
- The dataset is reletevly small and linearly separable for features like petal length and width. SVM and shallow neural networks show high accuracy for this dataset.
- The dataset is balenced wuth 50 samples per class.
- The feature dimentionality is 4 and the model parameters were minimal due to feacture space and dataset size.
