# Iris_Dataset
This project demostrates the Iris dataset which contains a collection of flower measurements across three species. The goal is to demonstrate data visualization and basic classification between the species. This repository includes a media folder containing visual outputs and figures, a documentation folder with statistical information and supporting project documents, and a source code folder where all implementation files are stored.

# Implementation
The implementation consists of using the Iris dataset which consists of 150 samples with 4 features which includes pepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). There are several classification models utilized for these project. Outputs are found in the media folder.
