# Implementation
The implementation consists of using the Iris dataset which consists of 150 samples with 4 features which includes pepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). There are several classification models utilized.   
# Requirments 
This project requires numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. It was developed using a Python environment through VSCode.
Use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install the dependencies.
# How to Use
To utilize this code, a Python environment is installed. Download the Iris.py or Iris_Classes.py (this one is organized into classes) along side the CSV file onto your computer into a folder. Then open that folder/file on VSCode. 
# Error Handling 
This project does not have any error handling.
